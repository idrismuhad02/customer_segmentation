# customer_segmentation**Customer Segmentation Analysis**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation using KMeans clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior and patterns for strategic decision-making.

### Contents:

1. **Introduction:**
    - Overview of the project and its objectives.
  
2. **Data Description:**
    - Description of the dataset used for analysis.
  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.
  
4. **Preprocessing:**
    - Data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
  
5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
    - Application of PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving important information.
  
6. **KMeans Clustering:**
    - Utilization of the KMeans algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups based on their similarities.
  
7. **Results Interpretation:**
    - Interpretation of the clustering results and identification of customer segments.
  
8. **Conclusion:**
    - Summary of key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
